# Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
## Definition
A systematic literature review is a work of collection, critical evaluation and synthesis of existing knowledge on a given issue. 
This well-defined question results from the study of a problem posed by a sponsor, a manager, a practitioner, a researcher...<br>
Contrary to a narrative and non-systematic review of the literature, the aim is to minimize the biases that may be inherent either 
in the raw material (data, knowledge) or in the conduct of the review itself, in order to achieve the greatest possible objectivity. 
Since bias cannot be reduced to zero, it is therefore necessary to highlight it and take it into account in the synthesis work so 
that any reader of the results and conclusions of the review can make them their own in full knowledge of the facts, understanding 
their limitations and the level of confidence (uncertainty) of the results. <br>

  **Fig 1** Research methodology for the literature review which consists of seven steps. Within each of these steps, the results 
  of the process are displayed. The arrows indicate the process flow. The numbers indicate how many documents were retrieved, discarded.<br>
## SLR's steps
### Step 1: Planning
### Step 2: Search
### Step 3: Title & Abstract Screening
### Step 4: Introduction & Conclusion Screening
### Step 5: Evaluation
### Step 6: Extraction
The research strategy employed must allow for a comprehensive search, in order to collect the greatest number of studies and reduce selection bias. There is no ideal strategy, and each question must lead to an appropriate research design. The search strategy should be based on a list of keywords and synonyms, which can be found in reference articles. These keywords, taken from free text or controlled vocabulary, must be included in the search according to a precise logic. The PICOT method can help to identify an appropriate search strategy by guiding the use of keywords and Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). Finally, it is possible to use predefined search strategies to filter studies according to their type, such as those proposed by the Cochrane Group to identify randomized controlled trials. The search strategy for studies should be developed at the time of protocol implementation and should not be changed afterwards, so it is essential that it is validated by all the authors of the review. The strategy employed and the results obtained must be documented at each stage of the research process.
