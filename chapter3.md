Through his professional column published in the 65th volume of the Revue française de science politique1 , Dominique Boullier has opened a salutary debate on the impact of big data on the ways of conceiving and practicing social sciences. This is a salutary approach, given that reflections devoted to this subject are still rare in political science, unlike other disciplines - mainly in language science, information and communication science, and computer science - which have, for at least a decade, been dealing with these new issues, with concerns that are sometimes close to those of political science (such as public opinion2, interpersonal influence3 or elections4). In order not to abandon the study of the web
political5 to actors - academic and commercial - who are often unfamiliar with the methods and and sociological theories, we share the idea that politicians must discuss the conditions of scientificity of digital data in their discipline. Pursuing this desire to open up the debate, we would like to discuss the notion of "science". third generation" proposed by D. Boullier to designate the new "third generation social ways to practice social sciences in the digital age. The author's programmatic proposal is based on three main postulates: 1/ the history of the social sciences is not not linear but marked by large epistemological ruptures; 2/ big data allows
to generate new information for the social sciences - the "velocity" of the traces left in real time by Internet users on the web - and are thus at the origin of a new epistemological rupture; 3/ this rupture requires a renewal of the notions and the sociological concepts to account for the phenomena studied on the web. 

the notions of "individual", "society" or "opinion" would no longer necessarily be the same. operating to analyze what is observed and played on the web. This is precisely because the traces left by Internet users would only have meaning if placed in their context digital :
"Digital traces [...] must be processed in their ecological environment and not reported to movements of society or opinion. »
Thus, the study of the big data would call for the constitution of an autonomous scientific field - that The author calls it the "third age of the social sciences" -with its own conventions, methods and concepts. While D. Boullier points out elsewhere that this new generation of social scientists has not to replace the previous ones - the author now prefers to talk about "points of view" rather than "generations", in order to underline the legitimate coexistence of the different epistemological traditions3 - or even to claim a monopoly on the study of big data.
Each "generation" proposing its own point of view on the object -, nothing would be of any use nevertheless to "run after their unification or their combination "
Each "generation" has its own specific problems and methods.
Here we wish to defend a complementary programmatic proposal: provided that we show methodological imagination, the "traditional" social sciences, which have been the subject of much debate in the past, will be able to provide the necessary tools for a better understanding of the problems and methods of each generation. can be perfectly armed to study numerical phenomena. Three postulates support this proposal: 1/ rather than being at the origin of a new "age". of social sciences, big data can on the contrary help to decompartmentalize the different epistemological currents and traditions; 2/ combining numerical methods with the traditional" methods can bring real cognitive gains to the social sciences, by allowing in particular to socially situate the collected digital traces; 3/ the concepts and "classical" notions of social sciences can always be effective in analyzing phenomena observed on the web.
# Real time Big Data 
Big data allows the study of the production of messages and digital data in real time, which is a completely new opportunity for quantitative social sciences. As an example, the analysis of the social network Twitter makes it possible to measure in real time, second by second, the number of messages published by Internet users during the televised debate between the two rounds of the presidential election. The curve tracing the evolution of the number of messages published can then be interpreted according to the comments exchanged by the candidates or the campaign themes addressed. Such a device thus makes it possible to measure, on a large scale, the oblique and fluctuating attention of the viewers, without the need for declarative surveys conducted on samples of viewers interviewed after the fact. 
Indeed, the big data also proves to be adjusted to the study of medium and long term social facts. The tools for collecting and archiving digital data in fact allow the establishment of longitudinal observation plans, over several years or even decades. At both the micro and macro-sociological levels, the collection, over several months or even several years, of messages from Internet users expressing themselves on the political field can thus make it possible to measure the influence of the political context on the level of politicization of ordinary discussions or to analyze the evolution of citizens' political concerns during electoral mandates. . In this perspective, the big data do not appear not exclusively dedicated to the study of immediacy and real time. Here again, digital technology can help to articulate the scientific objectives of the first and second generation of social sciences. Like sample surveys, the web allows, by promoting the constitution of observation plans on a micro scale (via, for example, the observation of individual accounts on social networks) and/or meso scale (via the analysis of the activity of a network at a time t), to better understand the individual springs of action. Let us specify nevertheless that the constitution of such observation plans remains for the moment only a methodological potentiality, still rarely exploited in empirical work: their constitution requires great methodological inventiveness and is dependent on future advances in computer science, particularly profiling techniques, as well as on the development of new methods of observation.
we will mount it afterwards. In addition, as with census surveys, the also allows us to analyze the spatio-temporal contexts in which we are involved action. In fact, in addition to authorizing observation plans over several years, we also authorize As we have said, digital technology facilitates geographical comparisons, precisely because national borders are, on the web, (partially) abolished. Proposing a comparative analysis of election campaigns in several countries on Twitter or Facebook becomes technically (but not scientifically) much less expensive to set up (without forget, however, the problems related to the wide variety of national laws and policies regarding the use of users' personal data in different countries). Thus, if big data undoubtedly requires the constitution of a new generation of sciences
It can also contribute to reinforce the dialogue between previous generations, due to the heuristic (via the wealth of available materials) and technical (with the progress of computer science and statistics) possibilities it offers. This desire to reconcile different epistemological currents and traditions has not appeared with big data. In electoral sociology in particular, more and more research is being done.
# Reconciling numerical and traditional methods
Indeed, big data can only make it possible to reconcile the different epistemological traditions of the social sciences on condition that new digital tools (tracking, tracing, mapping, etc.) are combined with the methods of investigation of generations (probability surveys, interviews, observations, etc.) by demonstrating that they have been as well as methodological imagination. Only this combination is, in our opinion, capable of remove the main epistemological obstacle encountered by sociologists or politicians (from first as well as second generation) interested in big data: the absence of socio-demographic information on the authors of digital traces.
