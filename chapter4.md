The issue of personal data protection on the Internet poses a dilemma for political science, and more broadly for the social sciences. On the one hand, the easy and immediate access to very large volumes of personal data on the Internet - what is now called big data is of real heuristic interest to researchers. The thousands of comments published daily on news and entertainment websites and on the Internet are a source of great interest for researchers. the information provided by the social-digital networks about their users are valuable sociological clues that allow for a better understanding of the better understanding of social and political phenomena. From another At the same time, access to these data raises difficulties and questions. ethical issues, in particular concerning the advertising regime, which is often indeterminacy of digital data and the difficulty of obtaining consent explicit and preliminary of all the Internet users whose information is are made public,or at least accessible, through sociodigital networks. Social scientists are then faced with a dilemma ethical and scientific analysis, which can be summarized as follows: opting for an analysis of big data" type but not being able to obtain the consent of the the authors of the data analysed, or obtain such consent, but work on small corpora, and thus forego some of the heuristic added value offered by big data.
# The scientific and ethical stakes of the big data in political science
Digital personal data and the computer software that allows them to be collected, archived and analyzed in very large numbers presents, for political science, a real heuristic interest (1) but at the same time raises a number of questions and ethical concerns.
## 1 Easy access to large volumes of "unsolicited" political data
When they focus on questions relating to political actors, institutions or public policies, messages published by Internet users on the Internet and social-digital networks constitute, for the political scientist, revealing clues to attitudes, practices and opinions that are particularly interesting to analyze. Personal digital data can be understood as a material survey data, as well as opinion poll data.
Numerical data nevertheless present a characteristic that differentiates them from other empirical data and gives them an undeniable heuristic added value: they are not the artificial product of a research interaction. Indeed, political messages published on the Internet have the particularity of not being data produced in a "laboratory" situation. A formula borrowed from the "hard sciences", the "laboratory" situation symbolically represents in the social sciences the phase of production and collection of empirical data, whether qualitative (individual or collective interviews, ethnographic observations, etc.) or quantitative (surveys, censuses, etc.). The use of data and empirical-deductive methods in the social sciences, theorized as early as the nineteenth century by Ã‰mile Durkheim, is based on the desire to practice the social sciences according to rules analogous to those of the natural sciences. However, unlike the so-called "hard" sciences, the objects of the social sciences - men in society - are beings that can adapt to the investigative situation and modify their behaviour and statements by consequence, which is precisely what constitutes the "misfortune" of sociologists and politicians. Respondents may attribute to researchers intentions which are not his but which will condition their answers, their manner of speaking or what they will choose to show or hide. In the case of opinion-forming surveys two artifacts have traditionally been associated with the technique of the survey: the risk of problem taxation and under-reporting of socially stigmatized votes and opinions, such as the vote for the National Front, systematically under-reported in opinion surveys, whether they are commercial or academic.
On the contrary, digital data of a political nature provide researchers with the guarantee that they are not survey artifacts. It is not at the request of a researcher or pollster that Internet users publish messages betraying their political opinions on the Internet. As such, these messages cannot be suspected of being a response of complacency to a problem imposed by the researcher. Moreover, the anonymity regime, in force on certain digital spaces of expression, authorizes a political expression partially freed from social constraints and pressures. As such, the researcher can access politically polarized opinions more easily than through traditional survey techniques. Finally, it should be pointed out that personal data provided by Internet users (gender, age, profession, etc.) or delivered, sometimes without their knowledge, by social-digital networks (geolocation data, etc.) allow for the social categorization of political messages published on the Internet. Following the example of questionnaire surveys, it is therefore possible to cross-check
political opinions analyzed with the social and political properties of their authors.
## Easy access to very large volumes of data
This scientific interest in digital personal data can be found in also strengthened by the development of IT tools allowing to collect, archive and analyze large volumes of digital data. A first interest of "big data" type analyses for science policy is to be able to analyze potentially exhaustive populations. Using dedicated software, a researcher can thus analyze the totality of the messages referring to the Head of State over a given period of time and over a network social given. In order to quantitatively analyze the political views of a given statistical population, it is therefore no longer necessary to resort to the use of sampling techniques. Sampling techniques also at center of scientific controversies concerning the representativeness of the samples questioned by opinion surveys. The "big data" then makes it possible to circumvent this problem of representativeness, by working on populations exhaustive.
Immediate access to very large volumes of textual data is this is an unprecedented phenomenon for the social sciences, which until now have been condemned to work on relatively small bodies of discourse, testimony and verbatim reports. With the development of software for partially automated lexicometric collection and analysis of digital data, researchers can now carry out quantitative processing of qualitative data, and conversely, refine the qualitative understanding of quantitative results. By analyzing the volumetric curve of the number of messages published on the social network Twitter about a given political actor, the researcher will be able, if he notices an unusual spike in the number of messages published, to analyze the content of these messages to better understand the origin of this statistical anomaly. This reconciliation of qualitative and quantitative approaches is thus proving to be unprecedented and promising for the social sciences.
