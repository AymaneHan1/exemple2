Prediction has been performed for a long time in the laboratory and by engineers for various tasks. High accuracy were achieved in numerous applications. But, in fields such as economics, ecology, political science, sociology, and many others, the over-abundance of influencing factors makes accurate prediction infeasible. At least, it has been thought so by scholars. So, the focus was on the development of repertoires of theories, models and mechanisms, hoping they can provide explanation and understanding even in the absence of accurate prediction.

Today, big data advocates are challenging these practices. If big data revolutionizes our ability to predict, then, naturally, a transformation should follow: scientists would need to prioritize prediction over explanation or causal understanding. In our study, we aim to clarify how big data has impacted political science, what kind of big data benefits this field and what the major opportunities and limits of big data in political science are. 

# Big data influence over sociological research
Political sciences [2] require knowledge about the dynamics of society. How did big data impact social sciences ? Records of human activity have always existed, since writing was invented. What changed today is the way data related to human activity is generated. Data come in various formats, in a casual and fast way. That is why we qualify some data today as "big data". The volume, velocity and variety characerizing such data require new computer-aided methods of collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. This helped a new branch of social sciences to emerge - computational social sciences. 
## Where does big data come from ?
The digital revolution introduced new variables to be considered in social sciences : humans started living socially via computers and Internet. Three forms of data become available to social scientists : digitalized life data, digital trace data, and digital life data. 

Digitalized life data are consequences of the migration from analog data to a digitalized form. Data were transformed when digital mahcines and systems were produced, and it is data required by these systems that we call digitalized life.

Digital Trace data represent data generated as a byproduct of numerical systems. For example, SMS' metadata were not meant to be collected. But, it turns out they can be used to study social networks, predict social behaviour, even track the spread of diseases. Digital trace data, unlike digitalized life data, are not useful for the system itself and their production is unintentional. 

Digital life data are data representing social life through digital media. Friending someone on Facebook and editing Wikipedia articles are acts of sociality on their own. Digital life on social platforms is viewed by social scientists in one of the following ways : they are models of society at large, used to observe social behavior like political mobilization, price setting, or patterns of social inequality, or they are new worlds to be studied, since new dynamics are allowed in the platforms, such as algorithmically aided radicalization or hyperdiffusion of fake news. 

It is also crucial to note that data are not just found. They can be made. All three of these sources of big data can be instrumented.
## What are the opportunities big data come with in social sciences ?
Big data enable several opportunities :
- Massive, Passive, Behavioural Data at Scale: Empirical sociology is based on self-reported data. The problem is that people’ views are not stationary and cannot be trusted all the time. Thus, the core of social study is what people do, not what they say they do and big data give access to records of behaviour itself. 
- Nowcasting: Contemporary society is built on the monitoring and publication of information about itself. This constant construction of the present is called nowcasting. Using big data to depict the present moment has several unique advantages over traditional methods. Data often update more frequently than traditional methods and can offer more geographic precision, measuring unemployment or disease prevalence for small, rural cities or at the neighborhood level. Because this is behavioral data, it can capture new, unmeasurable social states and dynamics. However, nowcasting is often dependent on the systems from which they draw data.
- Data on Social Systems: Individual platforms like Facebook and Twitter offer somewhat self-contained social systems. Researchers at Facebook have examined the spread of news on Facebook to understand the extent to which users live in filter bubbles, insulated by information that supports their worldview. One important dimension where big data is providing new insight into social systems is in transportation and mobility. Understanding the physical movement of people in the course of a day, week, year, or lifetime is essential to understanding a wide variety of sociological patterns like cultural change; access to social opportunities; social segregation, isolation, and inclusion; and the diffusion of ideas.

# Big data in political elections
The crucial question [1] we want to answer here is the following : how much could prediction, in political elections, be improved by the application of big data methods?

Opinion polling is one of the approaches used to predict the results of political elections. But this approach has several issues. The first concerns sampling error. The second concerns balanced samples ; for example, we obtain biased results if the sample is not balanced with respect to age, gender, race, or income. It has been proven that systematic aggregation of polls improves predictive accuracy, but is the accuracy reached weak enough to claim big data has revolutionized political elections study? 

Today, political campaigns increasingly use sophisticated big data methods. These have mainly taken the form of ‘microtargeting’ voters. Extensive data can now be collected about individual voters' consumption patterns, media preferences, demographic characteristics and so on, and algorithms track how these factors correlate with political preference and likeliness to vote.

The main problem is that the number of past elections is limited, so the available data is not sufficient to train predictive algorithms. Besides, opinion polls conducted by political campaigns represent political preferences, but do not represent whether people who expressed them are going to vote. UK general elections in 2015 and 2017 illustrate the fact that relating political preferences and likeliness to vote is incorrect and misleading. This particular case also illustrates another point ; non-stationarity in the causes. In fact, correcting what was believed to be the mistake in the 2015 elections predictions for 2017 also led to great inaccuracies. It turned out if the methodologies were reversed, predictions would have been better. 

One solution to non-stationarity is to perform short-term forecasting within a single campaign, assuming the chosen time period keeps correlations stable. This is achieved using one of two approaches:
- to run daily polls to help calibrate their inferences from data regarding consumer preferences,
- to utilize a campaign's extensive non-polling information, namely voters' responses to doorstep, phone and other interactions
These approaches help calibrate the derived predictors. But, even with these data, there is little evidence that big data algorithms outperform the existing theories and frameworks. The fundamental problem remains the same, namely that campaigns cannot observe individuals' actual votes.

Returning to actual practice, political campaigns certainly have ways of identifying likely supporters and also of estimating how likely those are to vote. But then, so do opinion pollsters. Can campaigns predict overall election outcomes better than pollsters do?
