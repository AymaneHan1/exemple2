## Big data and geopolitics

Data and new technologies have given a new dimension to inter-country politics. Today, having data centers for data storage, computers and know-how for data processing is a unit of measurement and an indicator of a country's development.

Data collection, in spite of the ethical questions it raises, has become a field of competition between nations. The classic example of this "arm wrestling" between countries for data collection is that of China and the United States. The United States has recently blocked the use of the Chinese application, TikTok, which has had exemplary success in almost every country in the world for the simple reason that the Chinese company collects data from Americans.

Given its importance, how data is collected, stored, protected, used, and transferred over national borders is becoming a geopolitical issue. Moreover, governing data inevitably runs into the differences in ideological visions of the internet and fundamental cultural divides. China’s insistence on internet sovereignty could be seen as a legitimate effort to control harmful or hateful information. Yet, from another perspective, it is a non-tariff barrier that limits foreign access to China's digital market.

**Territorialized data**

Speaking of territories when talking about cyberspace may seem paradoxical since data is often accessible anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, we have quickly seen borders penetrate this space, which is thought to be neutral and global. States have gradually developed technical, political and legal means to increase their control over cyberspace and the data that circulates in it.

Cyber attacks have become widespread since 2007: attacks against Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, the Stuxnet and Flame viruses against Iran. Processes in cyberspace by states or private actors are no longer surprising. Real digital technologies have emerged. This dynamic of territorialization at different local, national and regional levels has led to rivalry and power relationships involving a wide range of actors.

Data centers, a central technology in the field of big data and cloud computing, represent and model the physical presence of data. The location of this physical infrastructure.

**The Immediate Agenda**

The recent announcement of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suit to break up Facebook and the ongoing antitrust investigation of Google dominate the tech news at home. Abroad, Germany’s highest court ruled that Facebook broke concentration (antitrust) laws when it combined data from its different platforms, especially WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as other sites and apps. The ruling, which will be appealed, was a direct challenge to Facebook’s business model, for it permitted users to block the company from combining Facebook data with that of other sources.

The FTC case is twofold—that Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to strangle budding competition, and that customers were hurt by not being able to choose a social media platform that extracted less data for lack of competition in the sector. Legal experts disagree on the strength of the case, particularly the second charge. The one certainty is that the cases will drag on. Moreover, FTC actions seldom break up companies—the last major case was Microsoft in 1999. Instead, investigators usually opt for a less dramatic remedy—for instance, compelling tech giants to share their data in some way with competitors or new entrants, a reminder that data is the critical element.

The challenge of regulation—that internet technologies move fast while government processes are slow, especially if the action sought requires an agreement or treaty among nations—also afflicts legislation. As a result, there is always the risk that by the time a regulation is enacted, it will be obsolete, or worse, counterproductive. That challenge is illustrated by one old piece of legislation that has come under new scrutiny: Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act of 1996. Enacted in the early years of the web, its goal was to promote innovation, not to protect decency or privacy. As a result, the regulatory regime it established was permissive: platforms were given broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos posted on websites.

It is increasingly the target of criticism across the political spectrum. Trump and his supporters believe Twitter, Facebook, and their kin muzzle conservative views, and without the 230 protections, voices who felt they had been denied a platform could have sued. The other side of the political spectrum, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, maintains that Section 230 has permitted a slew of disinformation and harassment, and absent it, they argue, the sites would have to be much more careful in policing their content. A 2019 bill introduced by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) proposed ending legal protections for tech companies that did not agree to an independent audit ensuring that there was no political bias to their monitoring of content. 

The issue has become intensely political, but the fact is that the tech giants are caught in an impossible situation: on the one hand, they can no longer say they are just platforms, with no responsibility for what is on them; yet, on the other, they are neither willing, nor probably able, to become publishers, fully responsible for their content. Regulating them just like public utilities is one suggested approach. Another, somewhat akin to Hawley’s bill, is the model of the financial services industry’s watchdog, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is licensed by Congress but is a private nonprofit organization. Tech companies themselves could create something similar with guarantees of independence in its judgments and, ideally, with a license from Congress.

In a striking demonstration of how much global geometry has changed, neither of the two most noted pieces of legislation about data privacy so far has been enacted by a nation-state. Most important is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in force since May 2018. GDPR stipulates how data controllers and processors must collect and process data from EU citizens, regardless of where they're located. EU users who visit sites, irrespective of their location, must be told what data the site collects from them via cookies and users must explicitly agree.

The other major piece of legislation is the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into force at the beginning of 2020. In contrast to the GDPR, which in effect requires consumers to opt into data collection, the CCPA allows consumers to opt out. In that sense, it is less stringent than the GDPR. The CCPA gives users the right to ask a company to produce all the personal information it has gathered on them over the years, as well as all the categories of businesses it got that information from or sold it to. For both the GDPR and CCPA, if a consumer asks, companies must delete all the information they have on that consumer, and if they have shared personal data with another company, they must ensure that any subsequent company processing that data deletes it too.

The GDPR both sought to be and is being used as a template for other countries. Indeed, 132 countries have put in place some legislation to secure data and privacy. Brazil, Japan, and South Korea have followed Europe’s lead, and, in general, any nation interested in a trade agreement with the European Union must address data privacy on its terms. As Dean C. Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council put it, “in the absence of another approach, it’s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done.” In fact, Microsoft allows users to manage their data according to GDPR rules even if they aren’t EU citizens.
