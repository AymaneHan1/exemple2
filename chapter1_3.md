# Social Media Data in US politics

An increasingly important question for researchers in a variety of  fields is whether social media activity can be used to assess offline  political behavior. Online social networking environments present a  tremendous scientific opportunity: they generate large-scale data about  the communication patterns and preferences of hundreds of millions of  individuals . However, some researchers have questioned the validity of such data,  pointing out that social media content is largely focused on  entertainment and emotional expression, potentially rendering it a poor measure of the behaviors and outcomes typically of interest to social scientists.



Additionally, social media provide a self-selected sample of the electorate. A study  by Mislove et al. investigates this bias on the county level, finding  that Twitter data do not accurately represent the sociodemographic  makeup of the United States . Furthermore, right-leaning political communication channels, such as  #tcot (“Top Conservatives on Twitter”), are more active and densely  connected than left-leaning channels  Hargittai's work has been extremely influential in investigating  gender, income, age, and other social factors that create systematic  differences in Internet use, including Twitter. Researchers have also found that extraversion and openness to  experiences are positively related to social media use, while emotional  stability has a negative relationship. Taken together, these studies suggest that social media provide a biased, non-representative sample of the population.



Despite these issues, a growing literature suggests that online communication  can still be a valid indicator of offline behavior. For example, film  title mentions correlate with box office revenue, and online expressions of public mood correlate with fluctuations in stock market prices, sleep, work, and happiness . In addition, a number of studies have examined the relationship between online activity and election outcomes. However, many of these studies have been criticized for a variety of  reasons, including: using a self-selected and biased sample of the  population; investigating only a small number of elections; or not using sociodemographic controls . Tumasjan analyzed the relationship between tweets and votes in the 2009 German election, but these results have been criticized because they depend upon arbitrary choices made by the authors in their analysis .

Studies had shown that the amount of attention received by a candidate on Twitter, relative to  his or her opponent, is a statistically significant indicator of vote  share in 795 elections during two full election cycles. Note that this  is found in a random sample of all tweets during the first three months  before the two election cycles, despite the fact that Twitter has been  well-studied as a biased sample of the general population. And some researchers also suggest that social media data could be developed into measures of public attitudes and behaviors that could serve as  alternatives to polling data. While polling data remains extremely  useful, and has seen increased public interest with the rise of popular  polling analysts like Nate Silver, alternate data sources can serve as  an important supplement to traditional voter surveys.
