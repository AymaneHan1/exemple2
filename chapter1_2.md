# Big data in public affairs
The authors in [4] make an overview of some issues surrounding big data, and provided their perspective on how the field of public affairs should deal with the big data era. Big data in public affairs is a combination of administrative data collected through traditional means and large-scale data sets created by sensors, computer networks, or individuals as they use the Internet. In public affairs, new opportunities for real-time insights into behavioral patterns are emerging but are bound by safeguards limiting government reach through the restriction of the collection and analysis of these data. To address both the opportunities and challenges of this emerging phenomenon, the authors derive a definition for the expression "big data" in public affairs. Then, they review the methodological and analytic challenges of using big data in public affairs scholarship and practice. The article concludes with implications for public affairs.

Starting with the definition, in political affairs, big data includes : 
- data created by private citizens through their interactions with each other online,
- data automatically generated from sensors in, for instance, buildings, cars, and streets, that is automatically transmitted online,
- data that are automatically collected by public entities in the course of their operations ; this kind of data is characteristic of the public affairs field.

Concerning mechanisms, both structured and unstructured data are collected (including metadata).

When we talk about challenges, there are mainly ethical and privacy considerations, secrecy and security concerns also. In fact, several questions come to mind : 
- Who should have the ability to use public data and for what ends?
- How much data should government be allowed to collect from citizens, and for what purposes?
- How will data protection be ensured so that it is not used for evil?

There are also problems related to efficiency. And the questions that could be raised are as follows : Can the government deal with the huge volume of data efficiently? Is it worth the investment? 

# Big data and Policy making
Big data question some assumptions in the social sciences. Nowadays, we need to figure out the meaning of digital traces left by peopleâ€™s dse (display screen equipment) of digital technologies, how the role of digital media evolved in influencing public opinion, social and political participation, voting choices, social norms, and consumer habits.

In fact, big changes have emerged. For instance, for public policy making, the most important sources of big data [3] is the Internet of things : objects connected to the Internet that can communicate data. another source of data is data produced by public and private authorities for providing services. One example would be the data produced by banks and finance companies on transactions with credit and debit cards, which record dates, hours, places, addresses, shops, and amounts. Open data are another example. In addition to data generated by the Internet of things and by transactions, users of digital networks also produce data informing us on social media. These three sources of big data have applications in policy making. To illustrate the use of each of these data sources, there is e-consultation, where the objective is the adaptation of policies to the comments of its beneficiaries, has been adopted by the Italian and the UK national health services (use of social media data). Concerning the Internet of Things, street-level imagery and high-resolution satellites might help improving the social environment. Phone logs were used to measure the incidence of poverty in many situations. In economies with scarce sources of population data, but where mobile phones are increasingly common, these methods may help measure population characteristics.

Big data may be used to involve social actors into policy making. An example is the British network Mysociety (https://www.mysociety.org/), which involves citizens in public life through applications, such as TheyWorkForYou (https://www.theyworkforyou.com), aimed at checking politician actions, and, for local problems, Fixmystreet (https://www.fixmystreet.com/), where citizens can report an issue by indicating an area through its postal code and a map, and describing the incident. Users can upload pictures and videos to figure out in real-time what the authorities do to solve the problem.

The authors in [5] use the policy cycle to represent policy processes and policy development to provide a new look of how policy decision making can, potentially, be conducted based on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and big data. The article starts with some fundamentals about the general issue of governance. Then, the question of the integration of technology into policy making is treated. Last, the authors introduce what they imagine the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) would be in the policy cycle.
