# Big Data, an essential tool for influencing French and American election campaigns
While the year 2020 is the year of election campaigns in France and the United States, the Data Intelligence club is interested in the use of Big Data in the analysis of electoral data and the digital strategies employed by candidates in both countries. Sometimes flirting with the limits of ethics, these tools of analysis methods and data collection for electoral purposes now seem unavoidable. This first article is dedicated to the use of Big Data in the American and French elections between 2008 and 2016.
## The Emergence of Big Data in U.S. Politics
The use of mega-data has become a key element of contemporary electoral strategies. These new campaign techniques were first introduced in the United States through Howard Dean's candidacy for the Democratic primary in 2004.Howard Dean has been accumulating and classifying data on Democratic activists and creating large-scale databases. He later set up the first online support committees. Having a well-stocked, high-quality database has since become a strong asset for a candidate and a key tool in his or her communication. After his defeat, members of his digital team founded Blue State Digital, a pioneering company in data-driven campaign strategies. The company will be in charge of Barack Obama's digital campaign in 2008 and 2012. First in the United States and then in Great Britain, programmers joined the campaign teams and created start-ups to work with data for electoral purposes.
The political use of data in the context of the American elections since 2008 represents an innovation on two levels: on the one hand, the constitution and qualification of a political database that can be used, and on the other hand, the strategic and scientific analysis of these data. In 2008, the Obama campaign used mega-data to better understand the history of voter behavior and thus target electoral operations more effectively on the Internet and in the field. In particular, it used the Democratic Party's VoteBuilder software and requested the services of the Catalist company to collect both public and private information on 240 million Americans of voting age. This information includes age, socio-professional typology, consumer profile and civic commitments. By cross-referencing this information, the Obama campaign was able to build a predictive model of voting intentions and determine precisely the geographic areas and neighborhoods where it is most useful to maximize activism. It also made it possible to send "micro-targeted" messages to voters via email, mail or other means.

## The use of "Big Data" in politics is intensifying in the United States and is being exported to France. 
In 2012, during the second election of Barack Obama, the strategies of electoral Big Data take on a new dimension. Indeed, data analysis is developed at a scientific level by the mathematicians of the OFA (Obama for America) 2012 campaign. The success of the Obama campaign is undeniably based on the deployment of its teams in the field. This field deployment is supported by the data, but also by the ability to develop a model that can anticipate the electoral behavior of targets, particularly undecided voters, based on the data collected and their analysis. This involves establishing profiles of typical voters, obtained by cross-referencing and analyzing a mass of varied dataThe volume of personal data and electoral information that can be collected has exploded in ten years. This is a major breakthrough because the more accurate the social profiles of voters, the more effective the targeting of messages.
In France, the development of these new campaign techniques is taking place in a similar dynamic. As early as 2009, a report by the "Terra Nova" foundation based on interviews with the main actors of Barack Obama's 2008 American campaign emphasizes the importance of building a qualified database for the French Socialist Party (PS). The report indicates: Barack Obama succeeded in the "Orwellian" dream of any American candidate: to file the whole country. It is based on the technique of "micro-targeting": it is a question of consolidating the maximum of existing databases in order to obtain individual data on all voters. Since then, the importance of Big Data in electoral cycles in France has increased, giving certain companies specializing in electoral Big Data a strategic role in presidential, legislative and municipal elections. This is notably the case for the start-up Liegey Muller Pons (LMP), whose role in the campaign of Fran√ßois Hollande in 2012 and Emmanuel Macron in 2017 was highly publicized in the media.
## New technologies and tools enhance the breadth of electoral strategies based on Big Data
In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, electoral strategies based on mega-data analysis have evolved to an unprecedented degree. The advent of new technologies, more sophisticated tools, and powerful algorithms have enabled U.S. political parties to improve their Big Data strategies, target undecided voters, and guide their choices.
The candidates for the 2016 election, Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump, have called upon several companies specializing in the field of electoral data analysis. Fueled by the Help American Vote Act, a law passed in 2002 that makes election data available to everyone, these companies have access to a significant amount of public information from previous votes.
An important innovation in 2016 was the massive collection of data from social networks and the dissemination of highly targeted messages. Other methods, sometimes unethical, were used, such as the purchase of personal data via data brokers from private companies. For example, the National Rifle Association (NRA), the American arms lobby, does not hesitate to transmit data on its members to the Democratic and Republican parties. These procedures are legal since they are not regulated by American law. 
## The Big Data arms race between the Trump and Clinton campaigns in 2016
By processing millions of pieces of personal data accumulated from previous votes at private companies and on social networks, the campaign teams of both candidates were able to build highly effective predictive models to strategically direct their campaigns. Hillary Clinton's campaign multiplied the expenses and the use of these specialized companies (NGP Van, Civis, 270 Strategies, Analytics etc.). This campaign was very sophisticated and expensive in terms of digital technology and the use of electoral Big Data. To collect and analyze this data, it used the latest machine learning algorithms and poached about sixty developers from the GAFA. From this data, the Democratic Party's data specialists built a set of models capable of predicting a voter's likelihood of voting, his or her propensity for activism, and his or her position on certain campaign issues. It is clear that this extremely sophisticated campaign in terms of mega-data analysis ended in defeat. As a result, strategic data-based strategies are not the decisive core of electoral processes and their real influence on elections remains difficult to measure. 
Donald Trump also put a lot of faith in digital and Big Data in the 2016 campaign. Trump's bolder strategy identified several neglected states; the "rust belt". As a result, the candidate decided to focus on Pennsylvania and Michigan. In addition, Trump's campaign would have targeted 13.5 million voters in 16 states, including the Midwest. A successful strategy that demonstrates that it's not enough to just bet on data collection, but that it's necessary to have a real political strategy to put it to good use, which has allowed him to gain the upper hand over Hillary Clinton in the digital arena. 
## Trump Campaign's "Alamo Project": Megadata Analysis and Electora Microtargeting
Donald Trump implemented a strategy designed by Brad Parscale, in charge of the digital campaign. The "Alamo Project" was implemented and consists of a strategy of large-scale data analysis and targeted communication on social networks. Brad Parscale decided to leverage the social network Facebook to implement an advertising campaign of unprecedented scale. As part of this digital strategy, Trump also relied on American start-up NationBuilder and Cambridge Analytica. NationBuilder is the rising start-up in the electoral Big Data market. The tool is used to collect a multitude of data on individuals: voting history, donations, Internet behavior, etc. The assembly of this information allows political parties to target their potential electorate very precisely and to streamline the work of their activists. In September 2016, Trump's campaign also invested more than $6 million in Cambridge Analytica's DMP (Data Management Platform). 
Cambridge Analytica specialized in large-scale data analysis and communications consulting (the company was liquidated in 2018). Its objective was "to change behaviour through data" and it operated by mixing quantitative data processing, psychometrics, behavioural psychology and advertising targeting. The data collected and used by Cambridge Analytica comes from a variety of sources, but a considerable amount is drawn from Facebook. Using several statisticians and psychometrics specialists, the company tapped into the social network to identify users' cultural, social or religious habits and preferences. Through unethical methods, the company gained access to the accounts and personal data of more than 87 million Facebook users. In addition to the personal data left by Internet users, Cambridge Analytica relied on models derived from psychology to identify psychological profiles among part of the electorate. These data allowed us to profile each individual based on several hundred criteria.  The objective was to first determine their positioning with respect to the 2016 election and to identify undecided voters and the most strategic geographic areas. In a second step, this strategic data was used to disseminate highly targeted messages based on the psychological traits and beliefs of the identified individuals.
